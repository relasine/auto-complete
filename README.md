# Auto-Complete NPM Module

This repo contains an npm module for an auto-complete script. It was written using object-oriented programming and fits the basic structure of your typical prefix trie. It was originally created as a part of a Mod 2 project for the Front End Engineering program at the Turing School of Software and Design. My original repo for the project, entitled "Complete-Me" can be found [here](https://github.com/relasine/complete-me), and the specs for the project itself can be found on Turing's website [here](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html).
